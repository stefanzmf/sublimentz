After I used E-texteditor for about three years, I finally switch to Sublimetext.

Anyhow, these are my sublime settings that are as closest I could get to be like E (I kind of dislike when I have things TOO different than I'm used to).

All you need to do is to copy all files into `%appdata%\Sublime Text 2\Packages` folder (on Windows) or `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2` (on Mac)

So... Enjoy :)
